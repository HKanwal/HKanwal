# HKanwal Website

## About
This is a full stack project I am working on in my spare time. This repository includes all of the files of the website I am creating, temporarily named HKanwal. It is being developed using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js). I intend to make it a virtual portfolio of my experience and to feature all of the projects I have/am/will be working on.
